This series adds the counter delegation extension support. The counter
delegation ISA extension(Smcdeleg/Ssccfg) actually depends on multiple ISA
extensions.

1. S[m|s]csrind : The indirect CSR extension[1] which defines additional
   5 ([M|S|VS]IREG2-[M|S|VS]IREG6) register to address size limitation of
   RISC-V CSR address space.
2. Smstateen: The stateen bit[60] controls the access to the registers
   indirectly via the above indirect registers.
3. Smcdeleg/Ssccfg: The counter delegation extensions[2]

The counter delegation extension allows Supervisor mode to program the
hpmevent and hpmcounters directly without needing the assistance from the
M-mode via SBI calls. This results in a faster perf profiling and very
few traps. This extension also introduces a scountinhibit CSR which allows
to stop/start any counter directly from the S-mode. As the counter
delegation extension potentially can have more than 100 CSRs, the specificaiton
leverages the indirect CSR extension to save the precious CSR address range.

Due to the dependancy of these extensions, the following extensions must be
enabled to use the counter delegation feature in S-mode.

"smstateen=true,sscofpmf=true,ssccfg=true,smcdeleg=true,smcsrind=true,sscsrind=true"

This makes the qemu command line quite tedious. In stead of that, I think we
can enable these features by default if there is no objection.

The first 2 patches decouple the indirect CSR usage from AIA implementation
while patch3 adds stateen bits validation for AIA.
The PATCH4 implements indirect CSR extensions while remaining patches
implement the counter delegation extensions.
