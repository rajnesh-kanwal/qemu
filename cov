This series contains few miscellaneous fixes related to Virtual IRQs
and related code. The first patch changes CSR mask widths to 64bit
as AIA introduces half CSRs in case of 32bit systems.

Second patch fixes guest and core local IRQ overlap. Qemu creates
a single IRQ range which is shared between core local interrupts
and guests in riscv_cpu_init(). Even though, in the current state
there is no device generating interrupts in the 13:63 range, and
virtual IRQ logic in Qemu also doesn't go through riscv_cpu_set_irq()
path, it's better to keep local and guest range separate to avoid
confusion and any future issues.

Patches can be found here on github [0].
